Perl Object API

  my $outlet=Power::Outlet->new(                   #sane defaults from manufactures spec
                                type => "iBoot",
                                host => "mylamp",

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Power::Outlet is a package for controlling and querying network attached power outlets.  Individual hardware drivers in this name space must provide a common object interface for the controlling and querying of an outlet.  Common methods that every network attached power outlet must know are on, off, query, switch and cycle.  Optional methods might be implemented in some drivers like amps and volts.

=head2 SCOPE

The current scope of these packages is network attached power outlets. I have started with iBoot and iBootBar since I have test hardware.  Hardware configuration is beyond the scope of this group of packages as most power outlets have functional web based or command line configuration tools.

=head2 FUTURE

I hope to integrate with services like IFTTT (ifttt.com).  I would appreciate community support to help develop drivers for USB controlled power strips and serial devices like the X10 family.

=head1 USAGE

The Perl one liner

  perl -MPower::Outlet -e 'print Power::Outlet->new(type=>"iBoot", host=>shift)->switch, "\n"' lamp

The included command line script

  power-outlet iBoot ON host lamp

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

  my $outlet=Power::Outlet->new(type=>"iBoot",    host=>"mylamp");
  my $outlet=Power::Outlet->new(type=>"iBootBar", host=>"mybar", outlet=>1);
  my $outlet=Power::Outlet->new(type=>"WeMo",     host=>"mywemo");

=cut

sub new {
  my $this=shift;
  my $base=ref($this) || $this;
  my %data=@_;
  my $type=$data{"type"} or die("Error: the type parameter is required.");
  my $class=join("::", $base, $type);
  eval "use $class";
  my $error=$@;
  die(qq{Errot: Cannot find package "$class" for outlet type "$type"\n}) if $error;
  my $outlet=$class->new(%data);
  return $outlet;
}
